This project walks you through setting up facial recognition on a Raspberry Pi using a virtual environment, OpenCV, and the `face-recognition` library. With the release of Bookworm OS, virtual environments are now required to avoid conflicts with system packages â€” but donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s quick and easy!

### ðŸ“¦ Set Up Virtual Environment and Install Libraries

Open a terminal window and follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages face_rec

# Activate the virtual environment
source face_rec/bin/activate
```

Update your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

Install required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install imutils
pip install face-recognition
```

Install CMake (for compiling dependencies):

```bash
sudo apt install cmake -y
```

> ðŸ’¡ If you ever exit the terminal, simply re-run `source face_rec/bin/activate` to reactivate your environment.

### ðŸ§ª Configure Thonny to Use Virtual Environment

Open Thonny and set the interpreter to point to the `face_rec/bin/python3` inside your virtual environment so your code runs with the correct libraries.

### ðŸ“¥ Download the Code
